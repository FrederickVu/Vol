This project is purely expository. The volatility forecasting project utilizes the 'arch' package and generally follows the theory developed in Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis", especially Chapter 21. 

The LETF options pricing project includes an implementation of the SVI model and Cui et al.'s technique of calibrating the Heston model using an explicitly computed gradient.
